# WorKub : Coworking Space Landing Page

WorkHub is a landing page for a coworking space, created using Bootstrap. This project demonstrates my ability to design and develop responsive, visually appealing web pages with a modern and professional look. The landing page features sections highlighting the workspace's amenities, pricing plans, testimonials, and a contact form, all styled and arranged using Bootstrap's grid system and components. This project showcases my proficiency in front-end development and my eye for creating user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing designs.
